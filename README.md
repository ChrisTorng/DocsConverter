For Google Docs to Substack converting tool

My [previous experience](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/DocsConverter/discussions/2) on converting tool.

[My initial tests](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/DocsConverter/discussions/3) and [Current Plan](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/DocsConverter/discussions/4)

[SubstackEditorHelper.js](SubstackEditorHelper.js) can be import into [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), it hooks on Substack Editor, capture the paste event and do some converting job. It's far from finished. But proved this is achievable.

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then [install SubstackEditorHelper.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisTorng/DocsConverter/main/SubstackEditorHelper.js).
